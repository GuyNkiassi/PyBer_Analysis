# PyBer_Analysis

Pyber with Matplotlib

## Purpose

The purpose of the anlysis is to create a summary that shows a pivot datafram into new dataframe to be grouped by weeks to reflect the toal fares by city type
All three city typs show a raise or a peak at the end of Febraury. The urban city type showed a peak that last through April, while the other city type dwindle in the month of March.
The rural cith type increases leading into the month of April. The suburban cityy type starts to peak at the end of April, wehile the rural city type drops off.

### Summary and Recommendations

After merging two data sets and using the grouby() functions, the fare per ride and fare per driver averages were calculated resulting in the summary datafram by city type

The urban city type had more total drivers than total rides, which had a significant impact on the average fare per ride and fare per driver. which will lead us to say that the urband drives had to lowest average fare per ride and earned less than the rula drivers

The rral city typ had the least number of total drivers which shows to having the highest average fare per driver even though the ratio of total rides to total drivers is equivalent to the suburban city type.

After this analysis and reviewing the toal fare city type graph, the end of Febuary kicks off the increase fares and would be a good opportunity to launch a adversting campaign, which would also strategically help the other two city types.
